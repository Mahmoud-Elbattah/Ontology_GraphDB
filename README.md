# Summary
<p align="justify">
A graph database-oriented approach is utilised for manipulating ontologies, considering ontology as a large graph. The scalability and query efficiency of the approach are verified based on empirical experiments using a subset of Freebase data. The Freebase subset was utilised to build an ontology graph composed of more than 500K nodes, and 2M edges. More details can be found in our publication below:
